    Real Madrid was founded in 1902 and quickly made its mark in Spanish football. The club’s first period of dominance came in the 1950s when they won five consecutive European Cups, a feat that has never been matched. Led by legendary players such as Alfredo Di Stefano, Ferenc Puskas, and Francisco Gento, Real Madrid revolutionized the game with their attacking style and technical prowess.
    Since those historic victories, Real Madrid has continued to cement its status as one of the most successful clubs in the world. With an impressive tally of La Liga titles, Copa del Rey victories, and international trophies, including numerous UEFA Champions League titles, the club has consistently showcased its ability to thrive under pressure and deliver on the grandest stages.
